What are Interfaces in Java?
The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be 
only abstract methods in the Java interface, not the method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritances in 
Java using Interface. In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a 
method body. Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship. 


CommandLineRunner is an interface that has run() method. Which is used to execute some code just after the spring boot application has started. 
The main application should implement this interface and override its run method. In this run method, we write code like initializing 
our database with some value or any other logic which should be executed just after the app starts.
